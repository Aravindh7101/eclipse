Arrays-it used to stop the no.of data type  and variable
ex...
  int name1=
  int name2=
  int name3=
  ....
  int name100=
ex....array
 int[]name=new int[100]    --the total value is same data type in int

 it means collection of same data type 

* two types of declare array
   1) int[] tamil = new int[100]
   2) int [] tamil={90,20,40,10,50}

 * in array used objects 
 * the main purpose of array used for data type same 



array disadvantage
* static memory - means we already declare 5 space but we only used 3 sapce 
   remaining 2 sapce is waste. so this problem will solve used in "dynamic"
* another data typee not used in array
* continues declararion --[1,2,3,4,5] we want first index 5{5,1,2,3,4] this process 
   will hapenn it takes some time so slowness issue happen in cintinues declaration
